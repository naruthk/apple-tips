For those who are using a Bluetooth-connected keyboard or the Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad, you can press and hold the Command key to reveal the list of commands for the app that you are using.

Major apps like YouTube and Microsoft Word support this. This also applies for almost all Apple-owned apps on iOS 14.
