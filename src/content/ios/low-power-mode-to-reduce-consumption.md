To turn on **Lower Power Mode**,

1. Open the **Settings** app
2. Tap **Battery**
3. Turn on **Lower Power Mode**

Once it is on, the battery icon will turn yellow instead of the usual gray color. Also note that some features will be turned off such as background refreshes. Your app notifications will also be less frequent.
