If you lose your iPhone somewhere, then swipe from the bottom of your watch face and tap on **Find iPhone**.

Your iPhone will start playing a pinging sound similar to that of a submarine's sonar.

**Pro Tip:** If you Force Touch (press hard) on the Find iPhone button, your iPhone's flashlight will also be turned on. *But this feature only works if your iPhone is not unlocked (still on the Lock Screen)*
